# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.


So this was my first project in html and CSS, we’ve been brought to create a web page that will talk about one of our interest ,
 so for me I choose to talk about my city Marrakech-Morocco, places that you could visit once you are there ,our gastronomy that you will taste ,
 also some different activities that you could do at night, and at the end I created a page that should contain
 several information about the price of hotel car rental and quad...
The file "index.html" is the html file for the home page, 
"restaurants.html" is the html file for the Moroccan gastronomy page, 
"places.html" is the html file for where to go in Marrakech page, 
"night.html" is the html file for Marrakesh by night page, and at the end we have 
"hotel.html" wish is the html file for Hotels, cars, quads…to rent page.
I personally prefer to design my web page in the same html file because as u could see I use different style for every page but to 
respect the requirement  I created a stylesheet that contain things that I may use for different pages.
The information inside the page of Marrakesh by night may not be true and also, I want to say that Marrakesh contain a huge 
different places that you could visit and not only what I say in this project.
