                The Saadian Tombs are a historic royal necropolis in Marrakech, Morocco. They date to the time of the Saadian dynasty, and in particular to the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur (1578–1603). They are located on the south side of the Kasbah Mosque, inside the royal kasbah (citadel) district of the city. The tombs have, because of the beauty of their decoration, been a major attraction for visitors of Marrakech.

                Marrakesh was founded by the Almoravid Dynasty in 1062 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar and subsequently developed by his successors. Initially, the city's two main monuments and focal points were the fortress known as Ksar el-Hajjar ("fortress of stone") and the city's first Friday mosque (the site of the future Ben Youssef Mosque). The Ksar el-Hajjar was located directly north of today's Koutoubia Mosque. The major souk (market) streets of the city thus developed along the roads linking these two important sites and still correspond to the main axis of souks today. At one end of this axis, next to the Ksar el-Hajjar, a large open space existed for temporary and weekly markets. This space was initially known as Rahbat al-Ksar ("the place of the fortress"). Other historical records refer to it as as-Saha al-Kubra ("the grand square"), or simply as as-Saha or ar-Rahba.

                The Menara gardens (Arabic: حدائق المنارة‎) are botanical gardens located to the west of Marrakech, Morocco, near the Atlas Mountains. They were established in the 12th century (c. 1130) by the Almohad Caliphate ruler Abd al-Mu'min.
                The name menara derives from the pavilion with its small green pyramid-shaped roof (menzeh), meaning lighthouse (منارَة [manaara]). Although there is no actual lighthouse in the gardens, any building that sits at a high elevation is locally known as menara, such as the mosque Menaret manaara. The pavilion was built during the 16th century Saadi dynasty and renovated in 1869 by sultan Abderrahmane of Morocco, who used to stay here in summertime.

                The Ourika Valley is a valley of the Moroccan High Atlas located 30 km from Marrakech. It is mainly populated by Berber-speaking people and the Chleuh dialect. Despite its proximity to Marrakech, it is still considered a relatively unspoiled valley, both by its nature and its traditional mountain lifestyle.
                Urika is the name of one of the Masmuda tribes, described by Ibn Khaldun.
